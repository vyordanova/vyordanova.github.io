Hi, I am Veronika. I was a research scientist for 10 years - I spent some wonderful time in university, industry and research institutes while exploring the topics of robotics, autonomy, planning and reinforcement learning. This page summarises my achievements as a researcher. <br>
I have now left the field and joined a technical consultancy company - I talk to clients, manage projects, and lead sales efforts in areas like automation, sustainability and digital transformation. <br>
I am really enjoying working at the intersection of tech and business so if you want to chat about robotics startups in London, get in touch!
